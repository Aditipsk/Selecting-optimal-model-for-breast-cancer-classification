# Selecting-optimal-model-for-breast-cancer-classification
üìã Project Overview

This project aims to classify breast cancer as malignant or benign using various machine learning algorithms. The main objective is to evaluate and compare different models to determine which one performs best for accurate diagnosis.

‚öôÔ∏è Process

Collected and preprocessed the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset.

Applied data cleaning, normalization, and feature selection.

Trained multiple models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, and SVM.

Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Selected the optimal model based on overall performance.

‚ú® Features

Comparison of multiple machine learning classifiers.

Visualization of performance metrics (confusion matrix, accuracy plots).

Easy-to-understand workflow for beginners in ML.

üß∞ Tech Stack

Language: Python

Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

üìä Results

The project identifies the most efficient model for breast cancer prediction, helping improve early diagnosis and decision-making in healthcare applications.
